## Learning Goals:

Our main goal was to better understand global state management though learning and implementing Redux Toolkit. We practiced E2E testing with Cypress, used React hooks, Router, fetch calls, and exercised teamwork with the Git workflow.

## Technologies Used:
[//]: <>
- Redux Toolkit
- Fetch API
- Webpack
- Cypress E2E Testing
- React Framework
- Router v5
- LightHouse
- Wave Evaluation
- GitHub Issues & Project Board
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML & JSX

## Wins and Challenges:

- There was a bit of a learning curve with Redux, since it was our first time seeing and using this library. 

- Considering the size of our app, we constructed very thorough E2E testing using Cypress. 

- It was a challenge connecting all of the many components and deviating from the expected structure to accommodate the scope of the project
